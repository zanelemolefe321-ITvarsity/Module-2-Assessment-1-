        <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
        <p>The giraffe is an African articodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestial animal and the largest rumminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However the existence of up to eight extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other species are exctint, prehistoric species known from fossils.</p>
        <p>Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3-5.7 m(14.1-18.7 ft)tall, with males taller than females. The tallest recorded male was 5.88 m(19.3 ft)and the tallest recorded female was 5.17 m(170 ft)tall. The average weight is 1.192 kg(2.628 lb)for an adult male and 828 kg(1.825 lb)for an adult female with maximum weights of 1.930 kg(4.250 lb)and 1.180 kg(2.600 lb)having been recorded for males and females, respectively. Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short. Located at both sides of the head, the giraffe's large, bulging eyes gives it good all-round vision from its great height. Giraffes see in colour and their senses of hearing and smell are also sharp. The animal can close its muscular nostrils to protect against sandstorms and ants.</p>
        <strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM<p></p></strong>
        <p>Giraffes are on the Southern side of the zoo, next to the Koala bear.</p>
