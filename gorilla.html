                   <h3>GORILLA</h3>       
                   <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forest of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                   <p>Gorillas are on the western side of the zoo, right before Mo's pizza.</p>
