        <h3>GORILLA</h3>
        <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forest of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living  primates.</p>
        <p>The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from as to 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos. The largest of the great apes, gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders, large, human-like hands, and small eyes set into hairless faces. The two gorilla species live in Equatorial Africa, separated by about 560 miles of Congo Basin forest. Each has a lowland and upland subspecies Gorillas live in family groups of usually five to 10, but sometimes two to more than 50, led by a dominant adult male-or silverback-who holds his position for years.</p>
        <p>The bond between the silverblack and his females forms the basis of gorilla social life. Females become sexually mature around seven or eight years old but don't begin to breed until a couple of years later. Males mature at even greater age. Once a female begins to breed, she'll  likely give birth to only one baby every after four to six years and only three or four over her entire lifetime. </p>
        <strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM<p></p></strong>
        <p>Gorillas are on the western side of the zoo, right before Mo's pizza.</p>
