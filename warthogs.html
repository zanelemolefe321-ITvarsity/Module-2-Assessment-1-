        <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
        <p>The common warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. in the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P.aethiopicus, but today that scientific name phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most wide spread species, the common warthog(or simply warthog) is Phacochoerus africans.</p>
        <p>Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance, with only the crest along the back, and the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired. The English name refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males. They also have very distinct tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches(25 to 64cm)in the males, but are always smaller in the females. They are largely herbivorus, but occasionally also eat small animals. While both species remain fairly common and swidespread, and therefore are considered to be of Least Concern by the IUCN, the nominate subspecies of the desert warthog, became extinct around 1865</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the warthog at pen E21, right next to the elephants.</p>
