        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
        <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx(oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formely included the East African oryx as a subspecies. The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia, where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals. Gemsbok are light brownish-grey to tan in colour, with lighter patches towards the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and black in colour. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and both both genders have long, sgtraight horns.</p>
        <p>Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail, has less black on the legs(none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. One very rare colour morph is the "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden. Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus oryx. They stand about 1.2 m(3.9ft) at the shoulder. The body length can vary from 190 to 240 cm(75 to 94 m) and the tail measures 45 to 90 cm(18 to 35 in). Male gemsbok can weigh between 180 and 240 kg(400 to 530 lb), while females weigh 100 to 210 kg(220 to 460 ib).</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen E15, right before the bears.</p>
