        <h3>KOALA</h3>
        <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representive of the family Phascolarctidaes and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family of Vombatidaes. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large spoon-shaped nose.</p>
        <p>The koala has a body length of 60-85 cm and weighs 4-15 kg. Fur colour ranges from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts futher south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
