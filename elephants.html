        <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
        <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidae. Two species are traditionally recognise, the African elephant(Loxodanta africana) and the Asian elephant(Elephas meximus), although some evidence suggest that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species(L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughtout Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surving family of the order Proboscidae; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>
        <p>All elephants have several distinctive  features, the most notable of which is a trunk proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and tools for moving objects and digging. Elephant's large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
        <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
